Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Claire, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer from Paris, France.
I have been coding for more than 2 years after a professional retraining via the Wagon bootcamp.

The tools I love working with are:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails and turbo-rails
- Stimulus / JavaScript
- Rspec for testing
- CSS and Figma for the design
